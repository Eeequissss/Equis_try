Again there are a number of ways to do this, but you should use the Numpy <code>mean</code> function. In this module, you will be asked to investigate the documentation for unfamiliar functions so that you can learn how to use them. You can find documentation on <code>numpy.mean</code> [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html). You should always look at the standard documentation first, and in this case there are examples of usage. However, if you find the documentation difficult to read at first you can always perform a web-search on examples of usage.\n",
